## Here are my links
1. [OtW's easiest Wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)<br> 
I did 20 levels during the holiday, and they helped me understand basic unix commands.<br>
2. [Cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/)<br>
This is where I learned cryptography. Mostly for my CtFs but kind of useful for OS anyway.<br>
